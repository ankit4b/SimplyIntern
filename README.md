“SimplyIntern:
One step solution for companies for skilled interns”

This system can automate the task of matching the student’s profile with the company’s requirements based on the skill set. We have proposed a student skill-based internship recommendation system where students are recommended a list of potential internships based on their skill set. When a new internship is posted by the company, based on the company requirement the system will recommend the internship to the students having those required skills and push notification through email. When one student applies the particular internship, the system will show the matching skill percentage to the company. When one company accepts the student’s application, the system will generate one certificate of acceptance and send the certificate to the particular student.
